AI photo Enhancer

Note - All the code for this small project has been written and edited using AI. Almost 400 prompts given in total using english language.
Database used in this project is MongoDB which is made and maintained by me (Akshat), for the image enhancement, API from replicate.com has been used.
This project took 3 days with 3-4 hours given per day, in total it took 12 hours for this project to complete. Cursor was used as the software for the development.
If you open any code file, it is fairly clear that no code has been written by me, i only checked for the errors and missteps but I hardly found any.

Making it better - If you are interested you can make this better by writing code yourself, not using AI. More updates will be provided very soon for the contirbutions.
